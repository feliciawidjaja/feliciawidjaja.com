            Hi, my name is Felicia and I came to Vancouver from Indonesia to continue my further studies in BCIT. I chose the CIT program because I love playing with technologies and programming seems fun.<br>
            Travelling is one of my hobbies. I've been to places like Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. My favourite place to travel so far would be Japan, as there are a lot of good foods there. I'm not really into watching movies but my favourite movie would have to be the Harry Potter series.
